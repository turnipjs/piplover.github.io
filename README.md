## Plug-in Plover
Software for a Raspberry Pi to make your Plover dictionary work on any computer!

Plug-in Plover or (PiPlover for short! Pretty serendipitous, I know!) is a (as of yet imaginary) software that you can run on a raspberry pi that runs Plover and ultimately simulates a keyboard for the connected full-size computer. This allows you to take your Plover dictionary everywhere you go! 

### When will PiPlover be available?
I am a full time student with a job and other hobbies, so I don't really know.

### Is it open source?
Of course!
